## Setup

Ensure you type the `ea` keyboard shortcut to evaluate all Elixir cells before starting. Alternatively you can evaluate the Elixir cells as you read.

## Enumeration With Non-Enumerables

Data types that do not contain multiple elements are not enumerable.
However, it's still sometimes useful to enumerate over non-enumerable data types.

Even though you can't enumerate over them directly, the trick is to convert
non-enumerable data into an enumerable data type.

### Integers

How would you convert integers into an Enumerable?
You can use the [Integer.digits/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Integer.html#digits/1) function.

```elixir
Integer.digits(123)
```

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, convert the integer `4389` into a list of digits.

```elixir
Integer.digits(4389)
```

### Tuples

Despite being so similar to lists, tuples are not considered collections.
That's primarily because they are intended as fixed-sized containers, and any case that requires
enumeration would likely be better served with lists.

To get around this if needed, you can convert a tuple to a list with [Tuple.to_list/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Tuple.html#to_list/1).
Now you have a list that you can work with as a collection if necessary.

However, if you find yourself doing this often, it may be a better
choice to start with a list instead of a tuple.

```elixir
Tuple.to_list({1, 2, 3})
```

### Strings

Strings are not enumerable, however there are several methods to convert strings to lists.

Strings can be converted into lists with either [String.graphemes/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#graphemes/1)
or [String.codepoints/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#codepoints/1).

Under the hood, strings are represented with a **codepoint**. A codepoint is an integer that represents
the character. Each character such as `"a"` has a corresponding codepoint. That's why the
function is called [String.codepoints/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#codepoints/1).

```elixir
String.split("abc", "", trim: true)
```

```elixir
String.codepoints("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")
```

For example, the code point for the letter `a` is `97`. Lowercase and uppercase letters have
different codepoints.

You can find the code point of any character by using `?` in Elixir. Evaluate the Elixir cell below
to see how `?a` returns `97`.

```elixir
?&
```

If you are curious, the full list of representable characters is called the [The Unicode Standard](https://unicode.org/standard/standard.html).

See this table for alphabetical characters and their code point values.
You do not need to memorize these values! You only need to be aware that each character has a corresponding codepoint.

```elixir
Utils.table(:unicode)
```

#### [String.graphemes/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#graphemes/1)

Some special characters are actually multiple characters combined.

You'll notice that é is actually 2 characters if you use [String.codepoints/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#codepoints/1).
Each character has its own codepoint.

```elixir
String.codepoints("é")
```

We use **grapheme** to refer to special characters that may contain multiple codepoints.
Therefore, use `String.graphemes` when you want to convert the string to a list without separating special characters
formed from multiple codepoints.

```elixir
String.graphemes("é")
```

Alternatively, you can use [String.split/3](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#split/3) to split a string based on some value.
For example, we can split a string by every comma like so:

```elixir
String.split("a,b,c,d", ",")
```

You can use this to accomplish the same behavior as [String.graphemes/1](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/String.html#graphemes/1) by passing a string as the second argument.
However this leaves whitespace from the start and end of the string in.

```elixir
String.split("abcde", "")
```

You can trim whitespace using the `[trim: true]` option.

```elixir
String.split("abcde", "", trim: true)
```

Now your string is an enumerable list of characters.

### Your Turn

In the Elixir cell below, convert the string `"Hello, world!"` into a list of single characters.

```elixir
String.split("hello, world!", "", trim: true)
```
